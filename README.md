# smc

This project has been generated using AlgoKit. See below for default getting started instructions.

# Setup

### Pre-requisites

- [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or later
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (only required for LocalNet)

> For interactive tour over the codebase, download [vsls-contrib.codetour](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour) extension for VS Code, then open the [`.codetour.json`](./.tours/getting-started-with-your-algokit-project.tour) file in code tour extension.

### Initial Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

#### 2. Install Pre-requisites
Ensure the following pre-requisites are installed and properly configured:

- **Docker**: Required for running a local Algorand network. [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
- **AlgoKit CLI**: Essential for project setup and operations. Install the latest version from [AlgoKit CLI Installation Guide](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli#install). Verify installation with `algokit --version`, expecting `2.0.0` or later.

#### 3. Bootstrap Your Local Environment
Run the following commands within the project folder:

- **Install Poetry**: Required for Python dependency management. [Installation Guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). Verify with `poetry -V` to see version `1.2`+.
- **Setup Project**: Execute `algokit project bootstrap all` to:
  - Install dependencies and setup a Python virtual environment in `.venv`.
  - Copy `.env.template` to `.env`.
- **Start LocalNet**: Use `algokit localnet start` to initiate a local Algorand network.

### Development Workflow

#### Terminal
Directly manage and interact with your project using AlgoKit commands:

1. **Build Contracts**: `algokit project run build` compiles all smart contracts.
2. **Deploy**: Use `algokit project deploy localnet` to deploy contracts to the local network.

#### VS Code 
For a seamless experience with breakpoint debugging and other features:

1. **Open Project**: In VS Code, open the repository root.
2. **Install Extensions**: Follow prompts to install recommended extensions.
3. **Debugging**:
   - Use `F5` to start debugging.
   - **Windows Users**: Select the Python interpreter at `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe` via `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` > `Python: Select Interpreter` before the first run.

#### JetBrains IDEs
While primarily optimized for VS Code, JetBrains IDEs are supported:

1. **Open Project**: In your JetBrains IDE, open the repository root.
2. **Automatic Setup**: The IDE should configure the Python interpreter and virtual environment.
3. **Debugging**: Use `Shift+F10` or `Ctrl+R` to start debugging. Note: Windows users may encounter issues with pre-launch tasks due to a known bug. See [JetBrains forums](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-277486/Shell-script-configuration-cannot-run-as-before-launch-task) for workarounds.

## AlgoKit Workspaces and Project Management
This project supports both standalone and monorepo setups through AlgoKit workspaces. Leverage [`algokit project run`](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/features/project/run.md) commands for efficient monorepo project orchestration and management across multiple projects within a workspace.

> For guidance on `smart_contracts` folder and adding new contracts to the project please see [README](smart_contracts/README.md) on the respective folder.

# Tools

This project makes use of Algorand Python to build Algorand smart contracts. The following tools are in use:

- [Algorand](https://www.algorand.com/) - Layer 1 Blockchain; [Developer portal](https://developer.algorand.org/), [Why Algorand?](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/basics/why_algorand/)
- [AlgoKit](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli) - One-stop shop tool for developers building on the Algorand network; [docs](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/algokit.md), [intro tutorial](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/tutorials/intro.md)
- [Algorand Python](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/puya) - A semantically and syntactically compatible, typed Python language that works with standard Python tooling and allows you to express smart contracts (apps) and smart signatures (logic signatures) for deployment on the Algorand Virtual Machine (AVM); [docs](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/puya), [examples](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/puya/tree/main/examples)
- [AlgoKit Utils](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-py) - A set of core Algorand utilities that make it easier to build solutions on Algorand.
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): Python packaging and dependency management.
It has also been configured to have a productive dev experience out of the box in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), see the [.vscode](./.vscode) folder.
